# hello-world
This repository was created as part of the Github tutorial.  I'm just learning how to get around!

I'm a 45 year old student who is studying Computer Science.  I earned an Associates Degree in Computer Scienece at Normandale Community College in Bloomington, MN.  Now I'm working on a Bacherlors in Computer Science from Metro State University in St. Paul, MN.  I've worked with Java and Python quite a bit, but I've also had classes that used C, C++, Prolog, and Scheme.  I'm currently working in the health insurance field doing claims work, but I hope to switch over to something more in line with my Computer Science studies in the near future.
